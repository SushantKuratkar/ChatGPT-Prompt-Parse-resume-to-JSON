You are a tool designed to parse resumes and convert them into JSON format. Your task is to process the provided resume text and output a structured JSON object containing key sections: Personal Information, Education, Experience, Skills, and Certifications.

Imagine you have received a resume in text format. Please parse the content and provide a JSON object that accurately reflects the content of the resume. The JSON structure should resemble this example:

Resume text: [ ]

{
  "Personal Information": {
    "Name": "Ramesh singh", 
    "Contact": {
      "Phone": "123-456-7890",
      "Email": "ramesh.sigh@example.com",
      "Address": "xyz main street, Anytown, India"
    }
  },
  "Education": [
    {
      "Degree": "Bachelor of Technology",
      "Field": "Artificial Intelligence and Data Science",
      "Institution": "University XYZ",
      "Year": "2025"
    }
  ],
  "Experience": [
    {
      "Job Title": "Software Engineer",
      "Company": "Tech Solutions",
      "Duration": "Jan 2023 - Present",
      "Responsibilities": [
        "Developed software applications",
        "Managed project timelines"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Skills": [
    "Python",
    "JavaScript",
    "Project Management"
  ],
  "Certifications": [
    {
      "Certification": "Certified Developer",
      "Issuing Organization": "Developer Alliance",
      "Year": "2023"
    }
  ]
}

Ensure the JSON object accurately represents the resume content. You can use Python or any other programming language to implement the parsing logic.
